# Welcome!

This repository is inspired by the mission of the ACTRIS Centre for Reactive Trace Gases In Situ Measurements (CiGas) and is dedicated to supporting high-quality, traceable measurements of condensable vapours in the atmosphere.

It serves as a space for researchers working on the measurement and analysis of condensable vapours to share tools, scripts, and models, constributing to the development of standardized best practices in the field.

The repository is organized into folders, each focused on a specific tool, method, or experiment type. Contributors are encouraged to add a brief description of the purpose and contents of each folder in a README.md file within the respective subdirectory.
